        Write a program that reads a list of edges representing an *undirected* graph from its standard
        input (given as a comma-separated list between square brackets, e.g. `[(A, B),(B, C),(C, D)]`).

        The program must add these edges, one by one, to an initially empty graph, and before adding each
        edge, it must determine whether that edge would introduce a cycle into the graph.

        In case the edge would introduce a cycle, the edge must not be added to the graph and the program
        should stop processing further edges. Otherwise, the edge is added to the graph and the program
        continues with the next edge.

        The program must then print how many edges were added before the first cycle was created.

        Your program must run in `O(m log(n))` time, where `n` is the number of nodes and `m` is the number of
        edges.
