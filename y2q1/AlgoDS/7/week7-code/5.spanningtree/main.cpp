        Given an undirected graph, write a program that computes the minimum spanning tree of the graph using
        either Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm, and then computes the shortest path (i.e., with the lowest path
        cost) between two given nodes on the minimum spanning tree.

        The program receives a list of edges representing an *undirected weighted* graph from its standard
        input (given as a comma-separated list between square brackets, e.g. `[(A, B, 5),(B, C, 10),(C, D, 2)]`),
        followed by two characters representing the start and end nodes (e.g. `A D`) - similar to assignment 1
        of this week.
        
        The program's output must be the cost of the shortest path between the start and end nodes on the minimum
        spanning tree, or `NO PATH` if there is no path between the start and end nodes.
